				<p>Some students have disabilities that affect their abilities to see, hear, pay attention to, or participate in activities in the same ways as their peers who do not have disabilities. Accommodations are adjustments to the way educational services are delivered to students with disabilities.
				Preferential seating means that a studentâ€™s seat is placed in a location that is most beneficial for his/her learning in the classroom. For example, if a student is very distractible, his/her seat might be placed away from doors or windows which tend to have more distracting activity.</p>
