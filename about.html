					<p>On January 10, 2014, Aleeha Dudley, who is blind, filed a complaint against Miami University in Ohio. 
					Miami University failed to ensure that all its courses and websites meet the standards. As a compensation, 
					it agreed to pay 25 thousand dollars to Aleeha Dudley, contribute 108 thousand dollars to help pay for her education, 
					repay 50 thousand dollars of her student loans and 102 thousand dollars for the pain and suffering. 
					In addition the University of California, Berkeley, cut off public access to tens of thousands of video lectures and podcasts in response to a U.S. Justice Department order to make its educational content accessible to people with disabilities.</p>
					<p>Did you know that many famous people had disabilities? Albert Einstein could not speak until he was three and had difficulties in mathematics. Walt Disney was diagnosed with dyslexia which affected his reading, writing and spelling abilities. Tom Cruise, 
					the Hollywood star, is also severely dyslexic.</p>
					<p>Designing accessible courses is important because it provides educational opportunities to all students.
					In 2016, the National Center for Education Statistics reported that the number of undergraduate students with physical and learning disabilities enrolled in American universities had increased from 6% in 1999 to 11% in 2012 all because of classrooms being more accessible.</p>
					<p>For example, a captioned video is not only helpful to the deaf student but benefits non-native English speakers. It also provides a sense of independence to students with disabilities.</p>
					<p class="dark">When it comes to accessibility, it is better to be proactive than reactive. You may be required to redesign majors parts of the online and in-class courses or assignments to make it accessible to students with disabilities.</p>

					<h3>What We Do</h3>
					<p>We understand that educators and teachers are willing to build an accessible environment if they can have access to guides and tools which will enable them to do so. We focus on building an interactive series which 
					will first help you understand what accessibility is in classrooms and then provide with resources which can help you implement accessibility in your classes.
